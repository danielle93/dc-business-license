<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    Do you need a DC registered agent to start your business?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="transition hidden">Yes. You need to list a registered agent on your business license application unless you are a sole proprietor and a resident of DC. This means that non-residents, corporations, partnerships, and LLCs all need to list a registered agent on the DC business license application.</p>
  </div>

What kind of DC Business License do you need?  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="transition hidden"><p>The DC business license you need really depends on your businesses activities. Retail and office type businesses usually just need a General Business License. The general business license classification is a catchall. It applies to businesses that have a tax identification number, but perform a business activity that does not require a special endorsement. </p>
    
<p>How do you get a DC Business License?</p>

<p>Some types of DC business licenses, including the DC General Business License, can be applied for on the DCRA Business Licensing website. </p>
<p>If you need a special license endorsement, you will probably need to file the paper form. You can download the DC Basic Business License Application (BBL-EZ) on the DCRA Business License Division website (see link below). The DC business license application is in your online account when you sign up for DC registered agent service. It is prepopulated with our registered agent information!</p>

Do you need a federal tax ID number to get DC general business license? </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes. Get your tax ID number before you apply for your DC General Business License.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
Do you need to register your DC business with the Office of Tax and Revenue?  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes. You can register on the Office of Tax and Revenue online or by filing the FR-500 form. Include a copy of the tax registration with your DC business license application.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
Do you need to get a Certificate of Occupancy to get a DC business license?  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>If you have a business premise located in DC and it doesn’t already have a certificate of occupancy, you will need to get one. If you live in DC and work from home, you will need a Home Occupation Permit. You can download the application on the DCRA website, but you have to submit it to the DCRA in person. They will take about 30 days to process the application.</p>
    <p>You don’t have to attach the actual certificate to your BBL-EZ application. Just write the Certificate of Occupancy number and issue date on the application.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
What does it mean to have Clean Hands?  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>You have to certify that you do not owe more than $100 to the DC government. This means if you have unpaid fines, parking tickets, or taxes you can’t get a DC business license.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
How do you renew your DC business license? </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>DC businesses have to renew the DC business license every two years. Your renewal fee is the same as the license fee, so if you have a general license, it will cost $200 every other year. The DCRA Business License Division will send you a renewal notice and invoice. Just follow the instructions on the DC business license renewal notice.</p>
    <p>A lot of DC businesses can renew their licenses online now. If your renewal invoice has a six-digit PIN number, you can use that to renew your business license on the DCRA website.</p>
